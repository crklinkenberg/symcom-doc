When symptoms are imported to the sources, for identification of different fields like Prüfer, remedy, author, comment, date etc. the program follows certain rules. These rules are also important when patterns are identified within the symptom text and user is asked questions for approval.

These rules are:

Rule 1:

Basic Rules relating to connection of symptoms in comparison page:

  

PASTE EDIT RULES ========================

Rule 1 : Paste Editing a Comparative Symptom in some section, will not change the same Comparative Symptom and Percentage in other sections.

Rule 2 : Multiple Paste Edits can be made in one section.

Rule 3 : If a PE is done on a Comparative Symptom in some section. The same Comparative Symptom in other sections cannot have a PE. 

Rule $ : PE is generally shortening of symptom text. 

CONNECT & CONNECT-EDIT RULES =========================

Rule 1: If a Connect-Edit is present in a particular section, then we cannot do another CE in the same section.

Rule 2: The Comparative Symptom which already has a CE, cannot be Connect-Edited again in any section.

Rule 3: If a Comparative Symptom already has a CE in some section, we should be able to simple Connect the same Comparative Symptom to other Initial Symptoms in other sections.

Rule 4: When we simple Connect a Comparative Symptom with an Initial Symptom in some section, then the Initial Symptom gets connected with the same Comparative Symptom in all other sections. Now, if we CE a Comparative Symptom in the same section and edit the Initial Symptom, then the Initial Symptom will change in all the connections of Comparative Symptoms in all other sections.

Rule 5: A Comparative Symptom that already has a simple Connect, will remain as it is, even if the Initial Symptom Changes due to a CE in the same section, resulting in a fall of Percentage. 

Rule 6 : CE is generally change of gradings in the symptom text. 

PASTE RULES ============

Rule 1: If a Symptom has a Connect or CE or Paste or PE then this Symptom cannot be Pasted anywhere in the Comparison.

Rule 2: Vice Versa, if a Symptom is Pasted, then this Symptom cannot have any Connect or CE or Paste or PE  anywhere in the Comparison. 

SWAP RULES ===========

Rule 1: SWAP can only be performed for Comparisons of Combined Sources and not on Single Sources. This is because, SWAP connections can occur only when the sources are from the same year or the comparing symptom year is older than the initial symptom year. In single source comparisons, the initial is always older than the comparing year, hence no SWAP is possible.

Rule 2: SWAP takes place only for Normal Connect and Connect-Edit When we Normal Connect or CE a Comparative Symptom with an Initial Symptom and the Initial Symptom is younger (or from the same year) than the Comparative Symptom, the system will prompt the User - Initial Symptom is younger than the Comparative Symptom. Do you want to Connect Vice versa or Connect-Edit Vice versa. (Depending on what action the user is taking, Connect or CE).

Rule 3: The Comparative Symptom which has been Swapped will have the SWAP icon highlighted everywhere in the document (Comparison).

Rule 4: If an initial symptom is swapped, no further connections can be done with that initial.

Rule 5: If an initial has any connections existing under it, then the symptom cannot be swapped.
