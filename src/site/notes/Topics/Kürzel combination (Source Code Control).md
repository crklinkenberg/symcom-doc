Source code is made combining abbreviations of authors + source name abbreviation 3 + band + year of the source.

For example: Source code can be : Jr SK2 1843.

Here "Jr" is author abbreviation, "SK" is title abbreviation of  the source, "2" is band and "1843" is the year.

### Technical Details:

PHP function `getSourceAbbreviationForMainSection()` controls the source code display in the main section. For the master data section which is controlled by API, the source code is generated by `SourceController` and the function `getSourceBookAbbreviationAttribute()` defined inside the model file `Source.php`.

These two functions have the same return output.
