For ongoing connection:

  

1. Comparing symptom after connect, further connect can be done with that symptom appearing under other initials.
    
2. Comparing symptom after connect, further connect-edit, paste and paste-edit cannot be done with that symptom appearing under other initials.
    
3. Comparing symptom after connect-edit, further connect can be done with that symptom appearing under other initials.
    
4. Comparing symptom after connect-edit, further connect-edit, paste and paste-edit cannot be done with that symptom appearing under other initials.
    
5. Multiple connect-edit cannot be done under same initial.
    
6. Comparing symptom after paste, further connect, connect-edit, paste and paste-edit cannot be done with that symptom appearing under other initials.
    
7. Comparing symptom after paste-edit, further connect, connect-edit, paste and paste-edit cannot be done with that symptom appearing under other initials.
    
8. Comparing symptom after swap connect or swap connect-edit, further connect, connect-edit, paste and paste-edit cannot be done with that symptom appearing under other initials.
    
9. If initial symptom has ongoing connection then no swap connect or swap connect-edit connection is possible.
    
10. If swap connect or swap connect-edit is done with one initial, no further connections or disconnections are possible with the other comparing symptoms appearing under that initial.
    
11. All connected comparing symptoms will be sorted chronologically with year when displayed.
    

For previous connection:

  

1. If a comparing symptom has previous connection like connect, connect-edit, paste, paste-edit or swap and if this comparing symptom is connected with the initial via any connection like connect, connect-edit, paste and paste-edit, then the previous connections will also get connected to the initial.
    
2. If initial symptom has previous connection like connect, connect-edit, paste, paste-edit or swap, then after connection of the initial with a comparing symptom, the previous connection of the initial symptom will remain in the same previous connection state.
    
3. Disconnection of a previous connected symptom will make the symptom a free symptom and the symptom will appear as initial symptom or comparing symptom depending on the source in which it belonged.
    
4. Any previous connection like connect, connect-edit and swap will not be affected and would act normally in all connection.
    
5. All connections between initial and comparing symptoms happens at one-to-one level. When comparing symptoms with previous connections are performed any connections, then the previous relationships die and new connection with initial symptom is established.
    

Important Points on Disconnection of Edited Connections:

  

1. If an edited connection is disconnected that is if disconnection is done on connect-edit, swap connect edit connections then the symptom will go back to its previous state, which means previous grading which was effective on the symptom before that connection will be active.
    
2. If a comparing symptom has previous connections as its children and the comparing symptom is connected to the initial, then for the initial symptom the children of the comparing symptoms becomes step children and disconnection amongst any of these step children will not affect the state of the initial or comparing symptom. 
    
NOTE: After the comparison is saved, if the saved source is again used as initial or comparing source in a new comparison then the connections in that source will be shown as previous connections.
