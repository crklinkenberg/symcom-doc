The editor privilege is controlled by the `$role` PHP value. It is “1” for editor and “2” for supervisor. In the editor role, when the comparison is saved, markings for initials with no comparatives are not given as there maybe further edits from the supervisor and those no comparatives initials may show comparatives with different cut-off comparisons. Only in supervisor privilege, when a comparison is saved, all initials with no comparatives are given markings and then processed for SQL completed table creation process after which the comparison becomes a final source ready for more comparisons.
