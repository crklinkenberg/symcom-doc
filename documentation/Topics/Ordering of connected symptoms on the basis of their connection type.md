Connected symptoms when displayed are displayed in order like: Connect Edit => Connect => Paste Edit => Paste.

  

This ordering is done in both front-end and back-end scripts. For front-end “connectionSort()” js function is used. For backend, connected symptoms when displayed “symptom-connection-operations.php”  php script executes the connected symptoms ordering before returning the symptom information to the comparison page.
